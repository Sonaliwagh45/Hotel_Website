				<p> The location was at the hill side. Just 10 minutes walk to start hiking.
					The staff would even assist me to get my scooter from a rental shop. Very helpful.
					The rooms are very clean.
					The security at hotel would look after your safety.
					Next to the hotel was the best vegetarian restaurant.
					Hotel price is reasonable.</p>
